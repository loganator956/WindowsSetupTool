# WindowsSetupTool

This is just a simple winforms tool that I have created in order to be able to automate various tasks of setting up my windows installs. 

## Features

- Install apps using winget

## Planned Features

- Install apps by downloading the installers from URL and running them
- Pull and place config files/directories into the correct places
- Be able to save and load presets (To automatically select which apps/settings to restore?)
